I am a passionate and driven Aerospace and Mechanical Engineer, pursuing my Master's degree at Syracuse University College of Engineering and Computer Science. My research interests include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Heat Transfer, HVAC, and Aerodynamics. 

With a robust background in HVAC engineering and research, I am at the forefront of spearheading projects focused on conducting load-shifting tests for heat pump water heaters. Furthermore, my academic journey at Syracuse University has been characterized by a deep dive into CFD modeling for heat pump units and the implementation of passive grid turbulence analysis. These efforts have not only led to remarkable reductions in energy usage but also significant enhancements in performance. Beyond academia, my contributions extend to the development of off-road vehicles and the successful implementation of Lean Six Sigma methodologies for scrap reduction for Hydromat Machines.

My proficiency in design tools such as SolidWorks and simulation tools like Ansys Fluent underscores my ability to navigate complex engineering challenges with ease. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for innovation, my technical prowess spans CAD modeling, FEA analysis, and process optimization, reflecting my unwavering commitment to driving excellence in engineering practices.
